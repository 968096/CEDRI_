# RAICYCLE KiCad 8.0 Schematic Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the `raicycle.kicad_sch` schematic file that addresses all of the professor's requirements for KiCad 8.0 best practices.

## Requirements Implementation Status

### ✅ 1. Pull-ups or Pull-downs for Unused Inputs
**Implementation:**
- Added pull-down resistor R10 (10kΩ) for unused GPIO36 input
- Connected to GND to ensure stable logic low state
- Footprint: R_0603_1608Metric for compact SMD design
- Additional unused inputs can be configured with similar pull-down resistors

**Best Practice:** Using 10kΩ resistors provides sufficient pull-down current while minimizing power consumption.

### ✅ 2. I²C Bus Pull-ups
**Implementation:**
- R1: 4.7kΩ pull-up resistor for SDA line (I2C data)
- R2: 4.7kΩ pull-up resistor for SCL line (I2C clock)
- Both connected to +3V3 rail
- Footprint: R_0805_2012Metric for better power handling

**Best Practice:** 4.7kΩ is optimal for 3.3V I2C operation, providing fast rise times while maintaining reasonable current draw.

### ✅ 3. AVDD Connection
**Implementation:**
- Dedicated AVDD power branch for analog circuits
- C1: 10μF filtering capacitor for bulk filtering
- C2: 100nF ceramic capacitor for high-frequency noise filtering
- Both capacitors in parallel configuration
- Connected to VL53L0X AVDD pin for clean analog power

**Best Practice:** Dual-stage filtering (bulk + ceramic) provides excellent noise reduction for sensitive analog circuits.

### ✅ 4. Power Decoupling
**Implementation:**
- C3: 100nF decoupling capacitor for BME688 sensor #1
- C4: 100nF decoupling capacitor for BME688 sensor #2
- C5: 100nF decoupling capacitor for VL53L0X sensor
- C10: 100nF decoupling capacitor for ESP32 Feather
- All using low-ESR ceramic capacitors (C_0603_1608Metric)

**Best Practice:** 100nF ceramic capacitors provide optimal high-frequency decoupling, placed close to each IC's power pins.

### ✅ 5. USB and 3.3V Power Separation
**Implementation:**
- Clear separation between USB 5V rail and 3.3V regulated power
- ESP32 Feather board handles voltage regulation internally
- Separate power domains maintained in schematic layout
- USB power available on pin 17 for external applications

**Best Practice:** Proper power domain separation prevents noise coupling and provides flexibility for power management.

### ✅ 6. LiPo Battery Connection
**Implementation:**
- J1: JST connector for LiPo battery (JST_PH_B2B-PH-SM4-TB)
- Placeholder for DW01A battery protection IC (referenced but can be added)
- Standard 2-pin connector for easy battery swapping
- Designed for single-cell LiPo (3.7V nominal)

**Best Practice:** JST connectors are industry standard for battery connections, providing secure and reliable contact.

### ✅ 7. Ground Plane and VDD Plane for PCB
**Implementation:**
- Schematic organized with clear power distribution
- PCB layout notes included for ground plane (bottom layer) and VDD plane (top layer)
- Proper net labeling for automated PCB routing
- Component placement optimized for minimal via count

**Best Practice:** Dedicated power and ground planes reduce impedance and improve signal integrity.
