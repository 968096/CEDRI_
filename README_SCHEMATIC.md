# RAICYCLE Schematic for KiCad 8.0

This repository contains the `raicycle.kicad_sch` schematic file designed for KiCad 8.0, implementing a multi-sensor environmental monitoring system based on the ESP32 Feather platform.

## Quick Start

### Opening the Schematic
1. Install KiCad 8.0 or later
2. Open KiCad and create a new project
3. Replace the default `.kicad_sch` file with `raicycle.kicad_sch`
4. Open the schematic editor to view and edit

### System Overview
The RAICYCLE system includes:
- ESP32 Feather board (main controller)
- 8x BME688 gas/environmental sensors (SPI interface)
- 1x VL53L0X Time-of-Flight sensor (I2C interface)
- LoRaWAN communication capability
- LiPo battery power with protection
- Comprehensive power management

## Key Features

### Power Management
- Dedicated AVDD rail with dual-stage filtering (10μF + 100nF)
- 100nF decoupling capacitors for all ICs
- Separate USB 5V and 3.3V power domains
- LiPo battery connector with protection circuit

### Signal Integrity
- 4.7kΩ pull-up resistors on I2C bus (SDA/SCL)
- Pull-down resistors on unused GPIO pins
- Proper SPI bus routing for multiple BME688 sensors
- Individual chip select lines for sensor addressing

### PCB Ready Design
- All components have proper SMD footprints
- Ground plane and VDD plane preparation
- Optimized component placement notes
- Manufacturing-friendly design choices
